# RoboVM iOS App Template
An out of the box working *RoboVM* template project for *IntelliJ IDEA*, **Maven**, and **Gradle** in order to build iOS apps.
Currently itâ€™s not possible to start the application from IntelliJ IDEA.

## Getting Started
* Prerequisites
	* Xcode
	* Java JDK 8

* The initial build takes around 2min.
	All subsequent builds are substantially faster.

* Run with Maven 
	`mvn clean compile robovm:create-ipa robovm:iphone-sim`
